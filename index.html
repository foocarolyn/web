      <p>
        I graduated from National University of Singapore with a Double Degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. My past experiences include API development for <a href="http://www.vsee.com/api" target="_blank">VSee</a>, self-update iPad menu for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tenza.Izakaya" target="_blank">Tenza Izayaki</a> and internal case management system for <a href="http://www.fycs.org/" target="_blank">Fei Yue Community Services</a>.

        As a software engineer, I believe that a project starts with understanding what are the root problems and needs. A successful solution should be simple, adaptable and intuitive for target users and results in a pleasant experience.
